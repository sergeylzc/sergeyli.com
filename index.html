            <h1>Hey, I'm Sergey Li</h1>
            <p>I've worn a few hats in my career—Product Designer/Manager, Solution Architect—and yeah, I can write code too. Building products is what I love doing most.</p>
            <p>When I'm not deep into building or designing, I like to share my thoughts and ideas. You can catch some of my writing over at <a href="https://www.littletunnel.com/" target="_blank">LittleTunnel</a>.</p>
            <p>I also team up with a friend at <a href="https://anywherearc.com/" target="_blank">Anywhere Arc</a>, our boutique software studio. We've crafted a couple of products that we're pretty proud of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://slippod.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Slippod:</strong> A desktop note-taking app that keeps your notes private.</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://textpixie.com/" target="_blank"><strong>TextPixie:</strong> A tool that helps you transform text, whether it's translating or extracting it.</a></li>
            </ul>
